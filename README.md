## About me

Hello, my name is Kean! I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Economics degree. I have a strong econometric, analytical, and statistics background and am currently looking to be employed in a data analytics role or any related field. 

In my time at college, I have performed academic research projects during my studies, which highly involved econometric analyses, including panel regressions, bivariate regressions, and time-series analysis, as well as their corresponding diagnostic tests. I also have an internship experience in data analysis and database management working under a region-based government agency. I have completed certifications for Power BI published from Microsoft, and undergone a course in Python for data science from Udemy.

Committed to my pursuit of a career in data analytics and more complex fields like data science, data engineering, or perhaps a master's in Economics, I continuously upskill from the fundamentals of statistics to the latest technologies commonly used in today's industry. Other than learning more about data analysis and other fields, I spend the rest of my free time playing video games (mostly [grand strategy or "*map-staring* games](https://www.google.com/search?q=grand+strategy+games), watching my favorite channels and streamers in YouTube and Twitch, and learning new cooking recipes.

## Power BI
### Sales Analysis

**Goal:** To present and report sales records and other related measures and provide insight on the company's performance.

**Code:** [Sales Analysis](https://github.com/keandrejimeno/SalesAnalysis)

**Description:** The database includes lists of sales records including sale and order information (order id, quantity, number of orders, product category, salesperson assigned, and location of resellers sold to). The project includes transforming the data, preparing measures and calculated columns, designing the model relationships, and generating interactive reports. The project then presents highlights and interpretations based on a fundamental understanding of business operations.

**Skills:** DAX, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualizations, KPIs, RLS

**Technology:** Microsoft Power BI

## SQL
### COVID-19 Database Exploration

**Goal:** To explore and prepare the data on global records during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Code:** [COVID-19 Data Query](https://github.com/keandrejimeno/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID19%20Data%20Query.sql)

**Description:** The data is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) which tracked and recorded daily metrics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including infection cases, deaths, tests and vaccinations, and other socioeconomic metrics, such as population. It includes 255 locations including countries and autonomous territories, and spans from 01-01-2020 to 10-16-2023. The code explores the data, selects relevant metrics, performs calculated metrics including infection rates, death rates and vaccination rates in proportion to the population, and highlights events such as the earliest time the country was vaccinated and their highest vaccination rate.

**Skills:** Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** Microsoft SQL Server

## Stata
### Determinants of WTP of Household Residents for PV Systems (Research Project)

**Goal:** To find the determinants of willingness to pay for photovoltaic systems and to find the average willingness to pay.

**Code:** [Estimating Determinants of WTP](https://github.com/keandrejimeno/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Estimating%20Determinants%20of%20WTP.do)

**Description:** This is research project is part of our thesis which is a prerequisite to complete the college program. The data (not publicly available) includes socioeconomic attributes including income, household members, credit access, etc., preferences and attitudes towards PV systems, and their answers (Yes/No) to the offered bid prices after learning more about the hypothetical product. The code is the construction of bivariate/multivariate and univariate probit models, diagnosis testing, and using procedures that calculate the average willingness-to-pay based on the given models.

**Skills:** statistical analysis, regression, hypothesis testing, diagnostic testing, results interpretation

**Technology:** StataMP 17
