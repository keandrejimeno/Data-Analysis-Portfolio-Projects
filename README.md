## About me

Hello, my name is Kean! I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Economics degree. I have a strong econometric, analytical, and statistics background, and I am currently looking to be employed in a data analytics role or any related field. 

I have performed academic research projects during my studies, which highly involved econometric analyses, including panel regressions, bivariate regressions, and time-series analysis, as well as their corresponding diagnostic tests. I also have an internship experience in data analysis and database management working under a region-based government agency. I have completed certifications for Power BI published from Microsoft, and undergone a course in Python for data science from Udemy.
